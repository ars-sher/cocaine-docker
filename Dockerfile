# Remember that you MUST run the outer container with --privileged flag or it won't work.
# Docker can be started as "service docker start", but since we use supervisor we will run magic wrapper from
# https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jpetazzo/dind/
# Tested on Trusty, but Saucy should work too. Precise will not since it has old kernel.

# There is at least one known (easily googled) problem with this docker-in-docker configuration, which doesn't have good solution.
# After 10-15 container runs loopback devices are getting exhausted; script ensure_loop.sh should help us with that.
# Maybe later it is better to switch on using the outer (native) system docker daemon.
